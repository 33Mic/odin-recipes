# odin-recipes
### What is this?
This is a little recipe book for a project on the odin project.

### Neat stuff! What did you learn from this project?
I've finally gotten some hands-on experience with commandline git, which I've been meaning to learn for a while. In addition to this, I learned a thing or two about proper commit messages (although now that I've seen some of my earlier commit messages, I certainly have some work to do.)

In terms of HTML, I learned:
- The boilerplate code for HTML, and what it all means
- How to add text (whether it be in the form of headings or paragraphs)
- How to create ordered and unordered lists
- How to add buttons/hyperlinks
- How to add images and adjust their size
- Proper file structure

### Any final remarks?

There's certainly many things to learn and also improve upon, and I hope to put more time into this as I learn more to make the website prettier :) enjoy the website!!
